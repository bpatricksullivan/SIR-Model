This project presents the SIR model for the spread of disease (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). The aim is to make the model approachable at the level of a high school calculus student with access to spreadsheets and or some simple Python programming, perhaps via Jupyter Notebooks, CoLaboratory Notesbooks or Replit. 

To keep the project conceptually simplisitic, both the spreadsheet solution and the python solution use forward Euler integration to keep the emphasis on model concepts rather than on higher order integration techniques. 
Upgrading the integration to Runge Kutta or leapfrog itegration may be a good exercise for students.
